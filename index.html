            The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People puts forward a principle-centered approach to 
            both personal and interpersonal effectiveness.Rather than focusing on altering the 
            outward manifestations of your behavior and attitudes, it aims to adapt your inner core,
            character, and motives.
